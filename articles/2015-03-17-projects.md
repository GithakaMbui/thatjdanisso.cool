Here are some of the things I've built:

## [isomer](http://jdan.github.io/isomer/)
A simple to use isometric graphics
library for HTML5 canvas. I built isomer as a fun graphics toy, but I
haven't found much use for it in my day-to-day. One day I'll make some art
with it.

I'm in the process of revamping isomer to use the popular
[three.js](http://threejs.org/) library for WebGL and all the performance
benefits that come with it.

## [cleaver](http://jdan.github.io/cleaver)
Cleaver generates quick slideshows from familiar Markdown. I built it because
I used to procrastinate before giving talks at my school's open-source club.

You can get slides up and running in 30 seconds, and it doesn't look half
bad!

## [tinman](http://jdan.github.io/tinman/the-shiniest-blog-engine-in-oz/)
Tinman is a blog engine that powers the blog you're reading right now! It
is my nth attempt at building a blog engine, and I decided to make it
small, simple, and opinionated. You feed it a directory of Markdown posts,
and it spits out static HTML. You can customize the templates with
JavaScript.

It's easy to fall into the trap of building a static site generator that
covers all the use-cases any blogger would want, but I decided to just cover
my own use-cases, and hopefully yours match well :)

Tinman was heavily insired by [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto).
