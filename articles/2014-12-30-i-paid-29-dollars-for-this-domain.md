Tonight, I bought a new domain.

I've been meaning to get back into blogging for quite some time. I have lots
of [silly Medium posts](https://medium.com/friendship-dot-js/) where I flex
my creative muscles, but very rarely do I write more meaningful things.

I built a [blog engine](http://jdan.github.io/tinman/the-shiniest-blog-engine-in-oz/)
a few months ago, and here's my chance to use it. It works okay!

But, above all, I needed an extra push to get back into writing. So I went
ahead and spent some money, got a stupid domain, dusted off some css, and here
I am writing to you.

I can't wait to see what happens.
