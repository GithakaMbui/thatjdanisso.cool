title: Ask Me Anything!
slug: ask-me-anything

Inspired by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama), I've decided
to make an "AMA" repo on GitHub. I don't know if anyone will use it, but I'll
leave it there anyway!

So, [ask me anything](https://github.com/jdan/ama) about Khan Academy,
accessibility, JavaScript, being a junior developer - anything that's on your
mind.
