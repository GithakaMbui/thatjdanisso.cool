During one of our weekly 1-on-1's, my manager [Marcia](https://twitter.com/marcia_lee) and I were speaking casually about some of the things I was interested in pursuing. I was a few months into my new job at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org), building tools for teachers and parents.

"I've had a growing interest in accessibility lately. Screen readers, Braille keyboards, that sort of thing," I said, offhand.

My internet pal [Cassidy](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) (but we met up once so I'll volunteer her as my IRL pal) had recently given a talk on web accessibility, and I had been poking around Bootstrap's source code, seeing various mentions of this "aria" thing. It all seemed pretty nifty, but admittedly I knew *nothing* about it, just that it helped people use the software I was writing.

"Oh cool, I'll keep that in mind," replied Marcia, although it was probably more enthusiastic than I can convey in a blog post. The rest of the walk was pretty normal - I think we saw some chickens that day.

Prior to starting my career, I spent a lot of my free time in college [building various things](/projects). I learned a lot this way - gaining some technical know-how, and even more non-technical skills like communication and time management.

It worked out well and opened lots of doors for me. But that's not really why I did it. I did it because I had a ton of free time (I was incredibly fortunate to not have to work my way through college, save a few internships for the experience), and I liked writing code. There was just something very *intriguing* about making a thing, showing it off, and having people provide feedback.

As I got into the groove of things at work, time passed, and my interests wandered. Issues built up, discussion died down, and I became less interested in the problems my open source projects were solving.

**Because at the end of a long day of coding, writing more code isn't the most appealing thing in the world, and that's okay**. The unfortunate side-effect is that the way I used to learn technology - reckless experimentation - no longer held a significant presence in my day-to-day.

My work projects were still very interesting, and offered me the opportunity to [use cool technologies](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and learn fun web things, but it was *different*. At work I had to follow style guidelines and deal with deadlines, while in college I'd spend three hours reading a rails tutorial and writing a blog engine I would never use. It's just inherently a different atmosphere.

So, I was in a bit of a funk. I found myself reluctant to work on side projects, and was worried I wouldn't be leaving my comfort zone enough at work. I was hungry to attack something I had *zero* experience with, just like I did in between classes in college.

An email found its way into my inbox about six weeks later.

![Email. Subject: Invitation: Chat about accessibility @ Fri Oct 24, 2014 11:15am - 11:30am (Jordan Scales)](/img/a11y-invite.png)

Word had spread that I was interested in accessibility (thanks Marcia), and an opportunity came up to do some accessibility work as part of a new series of projects at Khan Academy. I happily accepted, and started doing some research.

I found a [great talk on accessibility testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxh6B3ChLIc) by Google's [Alice Boxhall](https://twitter.com/sundress). In it, she mentions [Accessibility Developer Tools](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools): a suite of tools for accessibility testing. "Neat! I know some of these words," I thought, and added the link to my in-progress `a11y-resources.txt`.

I started making blanket statements such as "These things can be completed in about a day" and "These things may take a week or more to fix." They were broad guesses, I had no idea what I was doing, and I was loving every minute of it. **Here I was, once again feeling my way around a new world of software development.** One day I'd think I knew something and the next I'd learn I was wrong.

But I pushed forward and completed a write-up (My a11y puns have gotten way better).

Fun fact, not only was I terrible at accessibility, but I was also terrible at numeronyms - "Khan Academy" has **nine** letters between the K and Y (or 10 if you count the space).

Thus began a few weeks of accessibility fixes: trying to fix things, not fixing them correctly, then learning and re-fixing. Each day my colleague [John](http://ejohn.org) and I would share links in our "Accessibility" HipChat room, and attempt to answer each other's questions.

I realized that this sliver of software development was **far** larger than I originally thought, and it was full of well-thought-out standards as well as many unknowns. Lots of work to be done, and I was excited to dive in head-first.
